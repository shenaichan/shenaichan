## Hello!!

I'm Shenai :) Welcome to my GitHub! 

I'm currently a researcher and engineer at [Electra Research](https://www.electra.com), building a battery-integrated induction stove for a more distributed, resilient, clean energy future. 

I received my B.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering (with minors in Human-Computer Interaction and [Physical Computing](https://ideate.cmu.edu/undergraduate-programs/physical-computing/)) from Carnegie Mellon University in 2024. Afterwards, I spent a while at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com), a "writer's retreat for programmers" and one of the best places on Earth.

If you'd like to learn more about my projects and work history, please check out my [website](https://shenaichan.com) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shenaichan/)! 

Be well! Do great things! Thanks for stopping by :)
