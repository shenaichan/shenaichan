## Hello!!

I'm Shenai :) Welcome to my GitHub! 

I'm a recent graduate from Carnegie Mellon University, where I studied Electrical & Computer Engineering, Human-Computer Interaction, and [Physical Computing](https://ideate.cmu.edu/undergraduate-programs/physical-computing/). I just finished a twelve-week program at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com), a "writer's retreat for programmers" and one of the best places on Earth.

The focalizing force of my technical practice is my belief that technology can be a medium for presence across physical distance. I recently finished building Notes From Afar ([live site](https://notes-from-afar.onrender.com/), [documentation & code](https://github.com/shenaichan/long_distance)), a webapp where people can leave anonymous notes about their long distance friendships, relationships, and family. I've also been working on Hestia ([documentation & code](https://github.com/shenaichan/hestia)), an open-source home assistant that I'd like to serve as a hub for play with tangible computing and automations.

If you'd like to learn more about my projects and work history, please check out my [website](https://shenaichan.com) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shenaichan/)! 

I am currently seeking full-time software engineering roles, so please reach out if I seem like a good fit and you'd like to chat :) You can email me at shenaiwc [at] gmail [dot] com.

Be well! Do great things! Thanks for stopping by :)
